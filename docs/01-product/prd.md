# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Olympus Tech

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-02

-----

## 1\. Introduction & Vision

Olympus Tech is a platform that leverages a team of specialized AI agents, personified as Greek gods, to streamline and assist in the software development lifecycle. Our vision is to create an intuitive, powerful, and collaborative tool that empowers developers to build better software, faster. We aim to create a system where AI agents can autonomously work on projects, following best practices and clear guidelines.

-----

## 2\. Goals & Objectives

  * **Goal 1:** To create a highly automated development environment where AI agents can handle tasks from project creation to deployment.
  * **Goal 2:** To provide a customizable and intelligent experience by allowing users to configure AI agents to their specific needs.
  * **Goal 3:** To ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly for a global audience on both desktop and mobile devices.

-----

## 3\. Target Audience & Personas

Our target audience includes software developers, project managers, and tech leads. For detailed descriptions, see our [User Personas](https://www.google.com/search?q=./personas.md).

## 4\. Features & User Stories

### **Core Platform**

  * **Feature: Responsive Design**
      * **User Story:** As a user, I want to access and use all features of the Olympus Tech platform on my mobile phone or tablet, so I can manage my projects on the go.
  * **Feature: Internationalization**
      * **User Story:** As a non-Portuguese-speaking user, I want to be able to switch the platform's language to English, so I can understand and use the application effectively.

### **AI Agent Capabilities**

  * **Feature: Agent Configuration & Customization**
      * **User Story:** As a project manager, I want to configure the settings for each AI agent, such as their preferred models and APIs, so that I can tailor their behavior to my project's budget and requirements.
  * **Feature: Agent "Powers" (Mission, Capabilities, and Powers - MCP)**
      * **User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a clear description of each agent's "powers" (their specific skills and capabilities), so I can choose the right agent for a particular task.
  * **Feature: Specialized Knowledge with RAG**
      * **User Story:** As a developer, I want each agent to have its own specialized knowledge base (RAG system), so that when I ask 'Athena' about architecture, she provides expert advice based on best practices and my project's context.

### **AI-Driven Development**

  * **Feature: Structured Project Creation (BMAD Method)**
      * **User Story:** As a user, when I assign a new project to the gods, I want them to follow a structured process (BMAD method) to ensure the project is well-defined, assessed, and designed from the start.
  * **Feature: Advanced Agent Communication (A2A Principles)**
      * **User Story:** As a project manager, I want the AI agents to collaborate effectively with each other, sharing information and context (following A2A principles) to solve complex problems without my constant intervention.
  * **Feature: Optimized AI Interaction (Context Engineering)**
      * **User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI agents to understand the full context of my requests, leading to more accurate and relevant responses, which will be achieved by using the best context engineering practices.

### **Backend & Integrations**

  * **Feature: Multi-Provider AI Backend (LiteLLM)**
      * **User Story:** As an administrator, I want the platform to connect to multiple AI providers (like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), so I can switch between them to optimize for cost, performance, or specific capabilities.

### **Task Management**

  * **Feature: Enhanced Task Management Page**
      * **User Story:** As a project manager, I want a more intuitive and powerful task management page with advanced filtering, sorting, and visualization options, so I can get a clear overview of the project's progress at a glance.

-----

## 5\. Success Metrics

  * **Metric 1:** Number of projects successfully created and advanced by AI agents.
  * **Metric 2:** User satisfaction scores related to the accuracy and usefulness of AI agent responses.
  * **Metric 3:** Mobile user engagement and session duration.

-----

## 6\. Assumptions & Constraints

  * **Assumption:** Users have a foundational understanding of software development concepts.
  * **Constraint:** The initial version will focus on web application projects built with the React/TypeScript/Supabase stack.
  * **Constraint:** The platform must prioritize data security and user privacy, especially when handling API keys and project code.

This updated PRD should provide a much clearer and more detailed roadmap for development. It establishes a strong foundation for any AI, or human, to understand the project's goals and build accordingly. The next logical step would be to detail *how* these features will be built in the Architecture Requirements Document (ARD).
